# KIPR-Development-Toolkit
This is a package that includes everything you need to start developing software for KIPR

# Instructions
To install on your raspberry pi (or Linux PC, but functionality will be reduced if it works at all),

```` bash
git clone https://github.com/kipr/KIPR-Development-Toolkit

cd KIPR-Development-Toolkit

sudo chmod +x install.sh

sudo ./install.sh
````

This will install all of KIPR Suite as well as other software/documents that are necessary.

*This is currently in Alpha; currently trying to make this work more efficiently and turn any pi into a Wombat.*


# Qt Creator
Editing .ui files is usually easier if you use Qt Creator. After installation you should be able to run "qtcreator" to launch.

It is recommended to install qtcreator yourself on your PC because it will be easier to use on Desktop.

# Docs File
The docs file contains documents that past developers have made in order to help future ones.

The best place to start is the Wombat Developer Manual, which contains an overview of the controller.

The Developer Manual should constantly evolve.
